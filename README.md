## General Info
** Purpose **: This CTF is a collaboration between the FOSSCOMM conference and the CSC@UOM team. It aims to give a fun activity while the convention is running, and to help some people learn some things about security. Even though some challenges are flagged as medium or hard, this is a beginner friendly CTF



## FAQ
**When and where will the rankings be announced**: The rankings will be posted both on the [fosscomm2021](https://2021.fosscomm.gr/) and the [CSC@UOM](https://csc.uom.gr/) website. They will be announced 1-2 days after the end of the conference.

**What happens if I have equal points with someone else in the top 5**: We check the time the form was submitted. The fastest one has the advantage
